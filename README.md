# Threads
Java provides built-in support for multithreaded programming. A multithreaded programs contains two or more parts that can run concurrently. Each part of such program is called a thread, and each thread defines a seperate path of execution.

Thread exist in several states. A thread can be running. It can be ready to run as soon as it gets CPU time. A running thread can be suspended, which temporarily halts its activity. A suspended thread can be resumed, allowing it to pick up where it left off. A thread can be blocked when waiting for resources. At any time, a thread can be terminated which halts the execution immediately. Once terminated, a thread cannot be resumed
